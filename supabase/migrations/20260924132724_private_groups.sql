-- #756: Private Groups (ruling R25) -- a Group and its subtree, with their Tasks and Events, visible only to their members, the Managers and Responsibles on its path, and BC/Moderator; no Applications, no organization-wide Opportunity; entry by Appointment.
--
-- One rule, one helper. private.can_see_group decides whether a Member may
-- know a Group exists, and every read path that could carry a Private Group's
-- rows to an outsider calls it: groups_read and group_members_read (so
-- my_groups(), Administrare, /grupuri and every Group picker, which all read
-- public.groups under the policy), private.can_read_task (tasks_read and the
-- four Task-history policies), private.can_read_event (events_read and the
-- Event fan-out), the Announcement predicate, fan-out and readers list, the
-- Member Card, and apply_to_group's visibility step. Each call is a one-line
-- revert that turns a named assertion in private_groups.test.sql red.
--
-- The flag is stored on every Group of a private subtree rather than derived
-- from the path at read time: create_group copies the parent's value and
-- update_group_structure cascades it down in the same transaction and refuses
-- a public Child Group under a private parent (PT400 private_parent), so a
-- reader need only look at the Group itself.

  'Creates a Group (#582, ADR-0009). A top-level Group is BC''s and the Moderator''s (live level >= 6); a Child Group belongs to its parent''s Group Managers through private.require_group_manager, so a Group Responsible cannot create one. Malformed input is judged first, for everyone: PT400 invalid_group_name / invalid_group_category (the presentation label is department, project or team — the Organization marker is set afterwards by update_group_structure, never claimed here) / invalid_group_min_level / invalid_group_color. Every authority refusal is the one non-disclosing 42501 group_manage_forbidden, so an unknown parent, an archived one and one the caller may not touch are indistinguishable; an authorized actor gets PT409 group_archived instead. Minimum Level defaults to the parent''s (0 for a root), may not fall below the parent''s (PT400 group_min_level_below_parent) and may not exceed the actor''s own live Level (PT400 group_min_level_above_actor, Moderator exempt). p_is_private (#756, ruling R25) makes it a Private Group: a Child Group of a Private Group is private whatever the argument says, and starting a private Child Group under a public parent is BC''s and the Moderator''s choice (42501 group_manage_forbidden below level 6). p_manager_id appoints the Group Manager in the same transaction: an unknown or inactive Member is PT400 group_member_not_eligible and one below the new Group''s Minimum Level is PT400 group_member_below_min_level. A sibling name already taken is PT409 group_name_taken (groups_parent_name_uidx, still partial over native Groups until #591). THE PARENT IS CHOSEN HERE AND NEVER CHANGES (ADR-0009 amended 2026-09-20): there is no move command and there will be none — a wrongly placed Group is archived and created again, which is what keeps Department Cup attribution stable, since standings walk each Task''s live groups.path.';

BC and the Moderator only (live level >= 6); every refusal is the one non-disclosing 42501 group_manage_forbidden, an unknown id included. Full-state REPLACE (conventions OD5). Malformed input first: PT400 invalid_group_category / invalid_group_min_level / invalid_group_color / invalid_group_privacy (a null p_is_private is refused, never read as public) / private_not_allowed_for_organization (the Organization Group cannot be private). A CHILD Group''s Minimum Level belongs to its Managers, so changing it here is 42501 — the mirror image of update_group. Then PT409 group_archived; PT409 cup_not_top_level (only a root competes, groups_competes_top_level_ck), organization_group_exists (groups_one_organization_uidx allows one marked Group: clear the old one first), automatic_group_has_roster_members (turning Automatic Membership on while ordinary members are on the roster), automatic_group_accepts_no_applications (turning it on while the Group accepts Applications); PT400 group_min_level_below_parent / private_parent (a Child Group of a Private Group stays private) / group_min_level_above_children / group_min_level_above_actor; PT409 nothing_to_update. Turning a Group private (ruling R25) switches its Applications off and cascades both to its whole subtree in the same transaction; turning it public leaves the Child Groups as they are. The Minimum-Level raise behaves exactly as in update_group: PT409 group_has_members_below_level with the count in DETAIL unless p_confirm_removals is true, then the rows below the new level go and everyone affected is notified. This is one of the two commands allowed to write groups.category — it and private.create_group_impl are the only writers beside the three Wave 1 mirror functions, and conventions.test.sql''s sweep names them (ruling R16). It never writes groups.parent_id: a Group''s parent is fixed at creation (ruling R20).';
